# Rules
In order to maintain consistency on the wiki, we have developed a number of simple rules. While we appreciate that these can't always be followed to the letter it makes us happy when you try.

This wiki is for War Selection players as well as War Selection developers.

While we encourage you to list and document addons and gamemodes, it should be done in a fair way. This isn't a place to create advertisements - but it is a place to hoard knowledge about the War Selection ecosystem.

# Page Content
- It's **Lua**, not **LUA**, **LUa**, **lua** or **LuA**.

- It's **SENT**, not **SEnt**.

- It's **SWEP**, not **SWep**.

- It's **TOOL**, not **STOOL**.

- If you don't know how to name an argument or describe it, don't put **UNKNOWN** or anything like that, just leave it blank.

- Put **proper descriptions** for arguments and return values, not just their names with one word.

- Argument names **must** start with a lower case letter.
  - `Position` is bad, `pos` is good.
  
- Do **not** put type indentifier as first letter.
  - `iNum` is bad, `num` is good.
